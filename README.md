# Lander
Basically a clone of lunar lander.

## To Do:
- land / crash state
- fuel consumption
- Other UI
- Audio
- juice

## MVP:
- fix bug where audio and engine vfx keep going if you land while burning
- fix audio, better engine noise and setup logic so that you aren't restarting
it every frame that the burn input is pressed.
- UI
	- HUD
		- speed (change color if close to crashing speed?)
	- main menu
		- start
		- settings
		- quit
	- pause menu
		- main menu
		- settings
		- quit
	- success / crash menu
		- restart
		- settings
		- main menu
	- settings
		- volume
		- screen shake toggle

## Ideas:
- auto rotate when on ground
- max velocity
- autozoom
- varry sizes of landing zones and give points based on landing zone size
- landing timer
- settings - key remapping
- generate unlevel terrain with spots to land on
