# Lander
Basically a clone of lunar lander.

## To Do:


## MVP:
- ability to land / crash
- generate simple terrain with spots to land on
- ability to limit amount of fuel
- juice
	- screen shake
	- engine noise
	- crash explosion
	- particle effects
- UI
	- main menu
		- start
		- settings
		- quit
	- pause menu
		- main menu
		- settings
		- quit
	- success / crash menu
		- restart
		- settings
		- main menu
	- settings
		- volume
		- screen shake toggle

## Ideas:
- varry sizes of landing zones and give points based on landing zone size
- landing timer
- settings - key remapping
